# Gestify for On-Device Deep Learning
- Currently, this is just an initial exploration of the Spotify Features
- Used Andriod Studio (Ladybug) while developing
- Spotify needs to be downloaded on device where the app is running
- Note: Will need Spotify Client ID in local.properties

##### Here is an example of the current app being run on a Pixel 4 using the emulator.
